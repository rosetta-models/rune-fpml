## FpML as Rune

This repository is a¬†[Rune DSL](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl)¬†model that contains Rune representation of the FpML 5.13 schema, Confirmation view. The model was created by the importing the FpML schema .xsd files, which translates each FpML schema complex type into an equivalent Rune data type, e.g., FpML¬†`<dataDocument>`¬†is imported into the Rune model as type¬†`DataDocument`.

What is Rune?

- Rune is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that supports the modelling of operational processes for the financial markets' industry.
- Its purpose is to promote consistency and inter-operability between the various implementations of these processes.

What is FpML?

- FpML (Financial products Markup Language) is an open-source XML standard used for the electronic dealing and processing of derivatives transactions.
- It provides a protocol for sharing information and conducting business for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and structured products.
- Essentially, it facilitates the electronic exchange of information related to derivatives transactions, including swaps, options, and other structured products.

## ‚úçÔ∏è What FpML looks like in Rune

FpML can be parsed in Rune or by an xsd schema 

Commodity products in an FpML sample follow this syntax

```xml
     <commodity>
        <instrumentId instrumentIdScheme="http://www.fpml.org/coding-scheme/commodity-reference-price-1-0">HEATING OIL - NEW YORK - NYMEX</instrumentId>
        <commodityBase>Heating Oil</commodityBase>
        <commodityDetails>XXX</commodityDetails>
        <unit>GAL</unit>
        <currency>USD</currency>
        <exchangeId>EXCHANGEID</exchangeId>
        <specifiedPrice>Settlement</specifiedPrice>
        <deliveryDates>FirstNearby</deliveryDates>
        <deliveryDateRollConvention>
          <periodMultiplier>1</periodMultiplier>
          <period>M</period>
          <dayType>CommodityBusiness</dayType>
        </deliveryDateRollConvention>
      </commodity>
```

Parsed in XSD

```xml
<xsd:group name="CommodityProduct.model">
  <xsd:sequence>
    <xsd:group ref="CommodityReferencePriceFramework.model" minOccurs="0"></xsd:group>
    <xsd:element name="specifiedPrice" type="SpecifiedPriceEnum">
    </xsd:element>
    <xsd:sequence minOccurs="0">
      <xsd:choice>
        <xsd:choice>
          <xsd:element name="deliveryDates" type="DeliveryDatesEnum" fpml-annotation:deprecated="true" fpml-annotation:deprecatedReason="Enumerated representation of deliveryDates is deprecate in favor of a parametric representation. Rationale: There is a need to track all the possible nearby contracts used for pricing. The 'DeliveryDatesEnum' list can grow significantly. Use instead 'deliveryNearby' component that contain a deliveryNearbyMultiplier (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) and a deliveryNearbyType (e.g. NearByMonth, NearByWeek, etc.)."></xsd:element>
          <xsd:element name="deliveryNearby" type="DeliveryNearby"></xsd:element>
        </xsd:choice>
        <xsd:element name="deliveryDate" type="AdjustableDate"></xsd:element>
        <xsd:element name="deliveryDateYearMonth" type="xsd:gYearMonth"></xsd:element>
      </xsd:choice>
      <xsd:element name="deliveryDateRollConvention" type="Offset" minOccurs="0"></xsd:element>
      <xsd:element name="deliveryDateExpirationConvention" type="Offset" minOccurs="0"></xsd:element>
    </xsd:sequence>
    <xsd:element name="multiplier" type="PositiveDecimal" minOccurs="0"></xsd:element>
  </xsd:sequence>
</xsd:group>
```

Parsed in Rune

```xml
type Commodity extends IdentifiedAsset: <"Identifies the underlying asset when it is a listed commodity. A type describing a commodity underlying asset.">
    commodityProductModel CommodityProductModel (1..1)
    
    
type CommodityProductModel: <"A group used to specify details of a commodity underlyer.">
    commodityReferencePriceFrameworkModel CommodityReferencePriceFrameworkModel (0..1)
    specifiedPrice SpecifiedPriceEnum (1..1) <"The \'specified Price\' describes the nature of the underlying price that is observed. It must be be stated in the underlyer definition as it is not defined in the Commodity Reference Price. Example values of \'specifiedPrice\' are \'Settlement\' (for a futures contract) and \'WeightedAverage\' (for some published prices and indices).">
    commodityProductModelSequence CommodityProductModelSequence (0..1)
    multiplier PositiveDecimal (0..1) <"The \'multiplier\' specifies the multiplier associated with the Transaction. The \'multiplier\' element has two uses: (1) for Freight Transactions or any Calculation Period specified for a Freight Transaction, if an amount is specified as the Multiplier then it is captured by this element and (2) if the Transaction is a heat rate option, the heat rate multiplier is represented in this element. If multiplier is not provided, multiplier is assumed to be 1. (i.e. rate source states 1 BBL of Oil as 90 Dollars. Multiplier of 10 will change the value to 900 dollars.)">

## ‚öîÔ∏è¬†Supported Product Types in Rune

For a full list of support products, see the **supported types in Rune** in Appendix 1

<br>


## üîë¬†Root Types & Top-Level Elements

### Root Types

The `rootType` annotation marks a type as a root of the rune model.

For a full list of root types see the **root types** in Appendix 2.

<br>

### Base Types

_Document_

The `Document` type is the abstract base type from which all FpML compliant messages and documents must be derived.

Types `Message` and `DataDocument` extend `Document`

- `Message` - A type defining the basic structure of all FpML messages which is refined by its derived types.
- `DataDocument` - A document containing trade and/or portfolio and/or party data without expressing any processing intention. A type defining a content model that is backwards compatible with older FpML releases and which can be used to contain sets of data without expressing any processing intention


_Product_ 

The `Product` type acts as the base type which all FpML products extend. Within `Product` , the `identifier` and `productModel` can be defined.

Using `procuctModel` , all products can specify:

- primaryAssetClass
- secondaryAssetClass
- productType
- productId
- assetClass

<br>

_Rate_

`Rate` acts as the abstract base class for all types which define interest rate streams

<br>

_Leg_

`Leg` is a supertype. All swap legs extend this type.

<br>

_Exercise_

`Exercise` is the abstract base class for all types which define way in which options may be exercised.

<br>

_Asset_

`Asset` is the abstract base class for all underlying assets.

<br>

### FpML Schemas

With FpML 5-6 , FpML has been divided into several very closely related schemas to better support different types of business processes. Each of these schemas, called a "view", has a distinct namespace and element and type definitions. However, each view is built from the same source schema, and so shares a number of features, such as element names.

Supported views/schemas in FpML as Rune include:

1. Confirmation - This view is intended to be used for confirming the precise details of contracts and post-trade business events.

2. Transparency - This view is intended to be used for reporting price forming information about executed transactions to the public by reporting parties and execution platforms.

3. Record Keeping - This view is intended to be used for reporting the Primary Economic Terms of derivative transactions to Swaps Data Repositories from entities including market participants, execution platforms, and clearing or confirmation services. 

For more information on FpML views, see the FpML overview [here](https://www.fpml.org/spec/fpml-5-6-5-rec-1/html/confirmation/fpml-5-6-intro-2.html).

Supported FpML Schemas

Currently the model is based on FpML Confirmation 5.13. FpML Confirmation is backwards compatible, so actually is supports all FpML 5.x versions

| Version | Confirmation | Record Keeping |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5.13 | x | Roadmap |
| 5.12 | x | Roadmap |
| 5.11 | x | Roadmap |
| 5.10 | x | Roadmap |
